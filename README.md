# A clock that represents the time as hex color values
I saw a project a little while ago, where I discovered that the time (in format 00:00:00) works perfectly for hexidecimal codes. I decided to create a <i>very</i> small project using vanilla JS, to represent the live time as a color. 

The <code>body</code> background changes with the hex color, giving the site an almost meditative feel. 

Feel free to play around with the code!
